css dropdown menus
======

CSS 3 gives us the ability to hide, show and animate elements without the complexity of JavaScript.

Review the [slides] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fUQgAzzAgeozECQWocFyzHXIMVXBJu5dNtvoBPKUjOs/edit?usp=sharing) for lessons on transforms, transitions and animations

We can start by making a sample dropdown menu together in class. 

First, create a classwork folder, and inside that 

Work with the **classwork/01-css-dropdown/index.html** file.

Now we can update

```
www
  classwork
    01-css-dropdown
      index.html
      styles.css
  css
  js
  index.html
  README.md
```
